## Info
Designed for my Amiga 500 tower. Might fit inside a the factory A500 case. Functionally tested by Fletch with an A314cp. Will not work with a A1200 RTC since the appropriate clock signals aren't present on the A500 side expansion bus. Please solder bridge INT6_EN, unless you have a specific use case where it is not necessary.
